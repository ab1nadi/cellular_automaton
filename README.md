# Cellular Automaton Conway's Game of Life
A little project built with vite, two.js, and vanilla html5/css/javascript. That runs the Conway Game of Life cellular automaton.
Running on github pages at https://ab1nadi.github.io/cellular_automaton/

## Rules the cells follow: 
* A cell becomes alive if 3 of its neighbors are alive.

* A Cell dies if it has 1 or less neighbors.
